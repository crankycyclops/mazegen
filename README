This is primarily a programming exercise for me, but if you find some value in using it, have at it!

Requires the GraphicsMagick++ library. To install on Ubuntu, use this command:
apt-get install graphicsmagick-libmagick-dev-compat

Build has been tested with both Clang 8 and G++ 7. By default, we build using
G++, but you can change the compiler used by setting the CCX environment
variable.

Example (builds with Clang instead of the default G++): CCX="clang" make
